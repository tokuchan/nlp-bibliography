  Abstract                 = {Recently, there has been a rebirth of empiricism in the field of natural language processing. Manual
encoding of linguistic information is being challenged by automated corpus-based learning
as a method of providing a natural language processing system with linguistic knowledge. Although
corpus-based approaches have been successful in many different areas of natural language
processing, it is often the case that these methods capture the linguistic information they are
modelling indirectly in large opaque tables of statistics. This can make it difficult to analyze,
understand and improve the ability of these approaches to model underlying linguistic behavior.
In this paper, we will describe a simple rule-based approach to automated learning of linguistic
knowledge. This approach has been shown for a number of tasks to capture information in a clearer
and more direct fashion without a compromise in performance. We present a detailed case study
of this learning method applied to part-of-speech tagging.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical approaches to processing natural language text have become dominant in recent years. This foundational text is the first comprehensive introduction to statistical natural language processing (NLP) to appear. The book contains all the theory and algorithms needed for building NLP tools. It provides broad but rigorous coverage of mathematical and linguistic foundations, as well as detailed discussion of statistical methods, allowing students and researchers to construct their own implementations. The book covers collocation finding, word sense disambiguation, probabilistic parsing, information retrieval, and other applications.},
