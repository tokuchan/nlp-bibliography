  Abstract                 = {Recently, there has been a rebirth of empiricism in the field of natural language processing. Manual
encoding of linguistic information is being challenged by automated corpus-based learning
as a method of providing a natural language processing system with linguistic knowledge. Although
corpus-based approaches have been successful in many different areas of natural language
processing, it is often the case that these methods capture the linguistic information they are
modelling indirectly in large opaque tables of statistics. This can make it difficult to analyze,
understand and improve the ability of these approaches to model underlying linguistic behavior.
In this paper, we will describe a simple rule-based approach to automated learning of linguistic
knowledge. This approach has been shown for a number of tasks to capture information in a clearer
and more direct fashion without a compromise in performance. We present a detailed case study
of this learning method applied to part-of-speech tagging.},

  Review                   = {Summary:

In this paper, the authors propose that tagging text information using rule-based systems is at least as robust as doing so using stochastic methods. They propose an approach where a simple rule-based tagger is applied to a training corpus, then rule correction "patches" are automatically generated to adjust for any errors that obtain. When applied to a test corpus, the authors note that their rule-based system is at least as accurate as stochastic systems, adjusting for compatibility of the respective corpuses.

Pros:

* Rule-based systems are simpler for a human to comprehend.
* This system can automatically correct tagging results generated by any other system, possibly including stochastic ones.
* The results in this prototype approach 95% accuracy, which is impressive.

Cons:

* Rule-based systems are not as well-explored as stochastic ones.
* This approach may not be as broadly applicable as stochastic approaches. For example, image classification may be more difficult.},

This foundational text is the first comprehensive introduction to statistical natural language processing (NLP) to appear. The book contains all the theory and algorithms needed for building NLP tools. It provides broad but rigorous coverage of mathematical and linguistic foundations, as well as detailed discussion of statistical methods, allowing students and researchers to construct their own implementations. The book covers collocation finding, word sense disambiguation, probabilistic parsing, information retrieval, and other applications.},
